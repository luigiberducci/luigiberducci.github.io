## Racecar Gym:
I have been developing and maintaining [`racecar_gym`](https://github.com/axelbr/racecar_gym) with Axel Brunnbauer. 

This environment uses the Bullet physics engine and 
aims to facilitate experiments of **Reinforcement Learning** 
with miniature, [f1tenth](https://f1tenth.org/)-like racecars.

`racecar_gym` currently implements the Gym API and the PettingZoo API, and
supports **single-** and **multi-agent** racing scenarios with **several tracks** of increasing difficulty:
from simple circular tracks, to scaled F1 tracks (e.g., Spielberg) and real-world tracks built 
in our university facilities (e.g., Treitlstrasse).
