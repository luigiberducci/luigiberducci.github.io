As a visiting PhD student at UPenn's xLab, 
I'm thrilled to be collaborating with some of the most talented and renowned researchers in the field of 
Safe Autonomy and Autonomous Vehicles. 
Working alongside them broadens my perspective, allows me to learn new methodologies, 
and approach my research from new angles.

One of my **primary research projects** at xLab is to formalize the notions of **safety** and **performance**
in autonomous racing with specifications tools.
As part of this project, I'm developing **rulebooks** for safety/performance behavior specifications,
and use it in the loop with a **RL** agent to learn safe and fast **racing strategies**.

I'm honored to work alongside such talented and innovative researchers to tackle this challenge. 
I would like to specifically **thank Prof. Rahul Mangharam**, the head of the xLab group, 
for his support and guidance. 
His leadership has been instrumental in creating such an innovative and collaborative research environment.

Overall, my ongoing experience at UPenn's xLab has been amazing. 
I'm grateful for the opportunity and I look forward to making contributions to the field of autonomous racing and beyond!
