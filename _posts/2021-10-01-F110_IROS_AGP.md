On behalf of my collegues, I am very proud to announce this outstanding result in the 9th F1TENTH Autonomous Grand Prix, held in Prague at IROS2021!

The F1TENTH Autonomous Grand Prix is an international racing competition organized twice a year by the F1TENTH community.
The aim of this competition is to build and program the software for 1:10 scaled race cars to make them able to autonomously drive in challenging races.

This year, the TUW team participate for the first time to a physical competition, after the great result of
the previous year in the simulation competition.
The TU Wien team “Scuderia Segfault” was composed by Daniel Scheuchenstuhl, Dennis Erdogan,
Fabian Kresse, Felix Resch, Luigi Berducci, Moritz Christamentl and Stefan Ulmer,
supported by Andreas Brandstätter and under the supervision of Prof. Radu Grosu.
