I am honored to announce that our team Scuderia Segfault placed 3rd at the 10th F1TENTH Autonomous Grand Prix, 
held in Philadelphia (US) at ICRA2022!

As you probably already know, the F1TENTH Autonomous Grand Prix is an international racing competition organized by the F1TENTH community.
The aim of this competition is to build and program the software for 1:10 scaled race cars to make them able to autonomously drive in challenging races.

After having participated to the previous editions, once in simulation and once in the physical competition,
this year, our team had the chance to travel to the US to compete in the biggest F1Tenth competition ever organized!

It has been a tough competition and an amazing experience, that would not be possible 
without the financial support by our great sponsor TTTech, 
the supervision of Prof. Radu Grosu and the hard work of the team members: 
Daniel Scheuchenstuhl, Dennis Erdogan, Felix Resch, Luigi Berducci, Moritz Christamentl and Stefan Ulmer,
Andreas Brandstätter.
