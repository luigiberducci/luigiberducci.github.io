title: Hi, I'm Luigi
subtitle: Ph.D. Student in Reinforcement Learning
---

I am a PhD student at [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/en/),
working in the [Cyber-Physical System Group](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/orgs/e191-01)
under the supervision of [Radu Grosu](https://ti.tuwien.ac.at/cps/people/grosu).

My research interests lie in the study of learning-based approaches able to
cope with safety-critical environments, under strict operational constraints.

The target of my work is the enforcement of formal requirements on the behavior
emergent by automated learning approaches, specifically reinforcement learning.

The application area is autonomous driving and, more in general, robotic systems.

My main interests:
- Safe and robust learning in real-world systems
- Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving applications
- Assessment and validation of autonomous controllers
