This summer I have the great chance to participate to the CIFAR DLRL Summer School.

One year ago I start looking for Summer Schools and subscribe to the [CIFAR newsletter](https://dlrl.ca/subscribe/)
to remain updated about the next editions. 
I could not imagine to be selected to participate to the next edition!

This prominent program started in 2005, when CIFAR organized its first 
Deep Learning + Reinforcement Learning (DLRL) Summer School in Canada.
The community has grown over the years, and today it brings together graduate students, post-docs and professionals 
to cover the foundational research, developments, and applications of Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning.
