### Short Bio
Luigi Berducci received his M.Sc. degree with honors in Computer Science
at Sapienza University of Rome, Italy (May 2020).
His M.Sc. dissertation on Testing of Autonomous Systems through RL
was co-advised by Prof. Enrico Tronci (Sapienza) and Prof. Radu Grosu (TU Wien).

His research focus on the development of safe learning algorithms able to
operate under constraints in robotics applications.

Luigi won a GARR Scholarship in 2020 for the project ML4NP, where he investigated
with collegues from INFN Roma3 in the adoption of machine learning techniques
for background-noise suppression in the neutrino-physics experiment LEGEND200.
He received his B.Sc. degree with honors at Sapienza University of Rome in 2017.
