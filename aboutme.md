---

I am a PhD student at Vienna University of Technology,
working in the Cyber-Physical System Group under the supervision of Prof. Radu Grosu.

My research consists of investigation of learning approaches able to
cope with safety-critical environments, under strict operational constraints.

The target of my work is the enforcement of formal requirements on the behavior
emergent by automated learning approaches, specifically reinforcement learning.

The application area is autonomous driving and, more in general, robotic systems.

My main interests:
- Safe and robust learning in real-world systems
- Assessment and validation of autonomous controllers
- Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving applications

### Short Bio
Luigi Berducci received his M.Sc. degree with honors in Computer Science
at Sapienza University of Rome, Italy (May 2020).
His M.Sc. dissertation on Testing of Autonomous Systems through RL
was co-advised by Prof. Enrico Tronci (Sapienza) and Prof. Radu Grosu (TU Wien).

His research focus on the development of safe learning algorithms able to
operate under constraints in robotics applications.

Luigi won a GARR Scholarship in 2020 for the project ML4NP, where he investigated
with collegues from INFN Roma3 in the adoption of machine learning techniques
for background-noise suppression in the neutrino-physics experiment LEGEND200.
He received his B.Sc. degree with honors at Sapienza University of Rome in 2017.
