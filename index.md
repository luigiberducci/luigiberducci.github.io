title: Hi, I'm Luigi
subtitle: Ph.D. Student in Reinforcement Learning
---

I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.tuwien.at/en/">TU Wien</a>,
working in the <a href="https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/orgs/e191-01">Cyber-Physical Systems Group</a>
under the supervision of <a href="https://ti.tuwien.ac.at/cps/people/grosu">Radu Grosu</a>.

My research interests lie in the study of **learning-based approaches** able to
cope with safety-critical environments, under strict operational **constraints**.
The goal of my work is the enforcement of formal requirements on the behavior
emergent by automated learning approaches, specifically **reinforcement learning**.
The application area is **autonomous driving** and, more in general, robotics.

My main interests:
- Safe and robust learning in real-world systems
- Reinforcement Learning in robotics
- Assessment and validation of autonomous controllers
