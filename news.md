**[The Agency Foundations Challenge][Oct 2023]** 
Luigi Berducci and Harry Powell won the 1st prize (EUR 1250) at the online hackaton 
for the track on Agency-Preserving Reinforcement Learning!
Their winning project, 
*"Preserving Agency in Reinforcement Learning under Unknown, Evolving and Under-Represented Intentions"*,
was conceived and developed in two weeks.
